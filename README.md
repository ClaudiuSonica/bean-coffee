# Bean Coffee Landing Page ☕️📝

This README provides an overview of the mockup landing page for a coffee shop that I built using React, SCSS, and various design principles. The project focuses on demonstrating my understanding of Atomic Design principles, modular SCSS, the usage of CSS positioning and Flexbox, as well as utilizing the `useState` and `useRef` hooks in React. 🚀

## Project Overview 🌟

The Bean Coffee Landing Page mockup showcases my skills as a developer by implementing a visually appealing and interactive web page for a coffee shop. The mockup is built using React for the frontend development and SCSS for styling. It demonstrates proficiency in structuring a web application, creating modular and maintainable styles, and utilizing React's state management and ref system for interactive elements. 💡

## Atomic Design Principles ⚛️

The project employs the Atomic Design methodology, which emphasizes breaking down UI components into smaller, reusable elements. The components are categorized into five distinct levels: atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages. This approach promotes maintainability, reusability, and consistency in design. 🛠️

## Modular SCSS 🎨

Modular SCSS is utilized to keep the styling organized and maintainable. Each component is styled using its own SCSS module, which encapsulates the styles related to that specific component. This modular approach prevents style conflicts, encourages code reusability, and simplifies the maintenance of the project's styling. 🎉

## Usage of Positioning, Flexbox, and Layout 📐

CSS positioning techniques are applied to achieve precise layout and alignment of elements. Flexbox is extensively used to create flexible and responsive layouts, ensuring a consistent appearance across different screen sizes. This approach enhances the user experience and ensures that the page is visually appealing on various devices. 📱💻

## React Hooks - useState and useRef ⚛️🎣

The mockup landing page makes use of the `useState` hook to manage the state of interactive components. This allows for dynamic updates to the UI based on user interactions, enhancing the interactivity and user engagement of the page.

The `useRef` hook is employed to access and interact with DOM elements directly. It is particularly useful for handling focus, measuring elements, and triggering imperative actions. This hook enhances the functionality of the landing page by enabling seamless interaction between the user and the UI. 🤖
